# hackUST2023 Link3 Moralis Server

This repo is a demo for implementing a parse server for handling events emitted from Link3 marketplace Smart Contract on the Sepolia blockchain.

This repo is based on [parse-server-migration](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/Moralis-JS-SDK/tree/main/demos/parse-server-migration).

# Getting started
Please refer to [Moralis' official guide](https://v1docs.moralis.io/moralis-dapp/getting-started/self-hosting-moralis-server).

The event handlers can be found in /src/cloud/cloud.ts.
